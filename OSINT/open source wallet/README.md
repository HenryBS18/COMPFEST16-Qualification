# Title
open source wallet

# Description
Oh no, I accidentally pushed my secret key on github while developing an arbitrage bot, Now my money is stolen ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Can you help me identify who stole my money? Here is the file i pushed https://github.com/Firdausfarul/Neptunus/blob/master/interleave_testnet_backend/Arbitrageur_XLM_USDC.py . the flag is in blockchain, in one of the thief account.

# Hint
- Hmmmm......... why does some transaction have memo on it? could it be an identifier or something?

- If a person have multiple wallet, their wallet must somehow connected right? like sending or receiving to same wallet or address or entity like exchanges.
