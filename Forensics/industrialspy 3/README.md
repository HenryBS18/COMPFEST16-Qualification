Dear X,

I welcome you to the internship program at Collective Inc. Your first task is to figure out what happened to one of our servers. We have a suspicion that someone logged in and did something. We recovered some files to help you figure this out.

If you have figured it out, submit your report to nc challenges.ctf.compfest.id 9009.
